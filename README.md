# Northwind
Overview, this project uses SQL for Data Manipulation where I use aggregation, CTE, window function, and views are created. From Power BI I connect with MYSQL and views are uploaded on my Pbix file.

Database Reference: https://github.com/harryho/db-samples/blob/master/mysql/northwind.sql

Workflow
In MYSQL Workench I opened a new SQL query, and then I pulled the query from the downloaded file (https://github.com/harryho/db-samples/blob/master/mysql/northwind.sql
).

I created the views using this query
